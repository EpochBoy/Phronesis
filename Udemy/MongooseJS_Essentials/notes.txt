To use mongodb server on Arch:

systemctl status mongodb
systemctl start mongodb
systemctl stop mongodb

On other systems mongodb can be start with command 'mongod'
This requires that path /data/db exists(maybe windows only?)

If installed using brew : brew services start/stop mongodb

Mongodb default port is: 27017

To enter mongodb shell type
mongo

Commands within mongo shell:
show collections / Shows collections withing database
use example / Use which database, replace example with correct one
db.books.find().pretty() / Use only find() if you want a list like view

USE MongoDB Compass tool to get a good view of your database.
